        <div class="text"><span class="petsname">The cat</span>, also referred to as domestic cat or house cat, is a small domesticated carnivorous mammal.
            It is the only domesticated species of the family Felidae.
            Advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC.
            It is commonly kept as a house pet and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact.
            Valued by humans for companionship and its ability to kill vermin, the cat's retractable claws are adapted to killing small prey like mice and rats.
            It has a strong, flexible body, quick reflexes, and sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell are well developed.
            It is a social species, but a solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator.
            Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting as well as cat body language.
            It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by small mammals.
            It secretes and perceives pheromones.

        <div class="text"><span>The dog</span> is a domesticated descendant of the wolf.
            Also called the domestic dog, it was domesticated from an extinct population of wolves during the Late Pleistocene,
            over 14,000 years ago by hunter-gatherers, prior to the development of agriculture.
            The dog was the first species to be domesticated by humans. Experts estimate that due to their long association with humans,
            dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psittacidae"><img src="img/bird.png" alt="psittacidae" height="300px" width="auto"></a>
        <div class="text"><span>The family Psittacidae or holotropical</span> parrots is one of three families of true parrots.
            It comprises the 12 species of subfamily Psittacinae (the Old World or Afrotropical parrots) and 167 of subfamily
            Arinae (the New World or Neotropical parrots) including several species that have gone extinct in recent centuries.
            Some of the most iconic birds in the world are represented here, such as the blue-and-yellow macaw among the
            New World parrots and the grey parrot among the Old World parrots.

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish"><img src="img/fish.png" alt="fish" height="300px" width="auto"></a>
        <div class="text"><span>A fish</span> is an aquatic, anamniotic, gill-bearing vertebrate animal with swimming fins and a hard skull,
            but lacking limbs with digits. Fish can be grouped into the more basal jawless fish and the more common jawed fish,
            the latter including all living cartilaginous and bony fish, as well as the extinct placoderms and acanthodians.
            Most fish are cold-blooded, their body temperature varying with the surrounding water, though some large active swimmers
            like white shark and tuna can hold a higher core temperature. Many fish can communicate acoustically with each other, such as during courtship displays.

        <p>            
            I am a student of a course in web development in Python.
            I'm making this page about animals because
            I like this topic and want to continue the idea of the pages from the previous homework.
